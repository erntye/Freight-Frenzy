Freight Frenzy is an endless game where the aim is to gain as many points as possible before losing all your lives!

Initially, the player controls a delivery truck driving around in the port.  There are 3 possible lanes: left, right, and centre.

The controls are simple! Swipe left to move one lane to the left, and swipe right to move one lane to the right. Swiping up allows one to speed up and swiping downwards will brake and slow the vehicle down. 

To turn around corners, keep to the innermost lanes at the bends (leftmost lane for left turn, and rightmost lane for right turn).

__Keep to the innermost lane to turn at bends__

There are 2 avenues for gaining points. 
- The player gains points passively as long as he survives
- The player gains points for every successful container delivery

The player can *collect* containers by controlling his speed and timing the vehicle to coincide with cranes which lower and raise on the *rightmost* lane.  The player then *delivers* them by doing the same for cranes at the unloading bays on the *leftmost* lane. (Picture Below)

__Loading Bay on the Right Lane__

For each container that the player successfully delivers, the Combo Bar fills up a quarter. When the Combo Bar is full, the player then transfers to a Freighter to deliver the cargo to another port. The player has to be quick though as the combo bar decreases steadily over time.

__Freight Frenzy Mode__

Once the Freighter docks successfully, the player continues picking up and delivering containers in the truck until he manages to fill up the combo bar again. 

Throughout the game, the player has to avoid obstacles and road hazards and can collect coins which he can subsequently use to unlock power-ups and upgrade his vehicle in the Garage.

## Road Hazards

### Cones and Barriers
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Road1.png" width="50"> <img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Road2.png" width="50"> 
- These are static obstacles that the player must avoid by changing lanes, lest they lose a life.

### Port workers
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Road3.png" width="50">

- Port workers walk across the road. Just like cones and barriers, players must dodge them to avoid losing a life.

### Haze
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Road4.png" width="50">

- This debuff enshrouds the player in a temporary smog which impedes his vision, making gameplay more challenging.

### Oil Spills
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Road5.png" width="50">

- This debuff reverses the player’s controls, such that swiping right turns the vehicle left, swiping up speeds up instead of slows down the vehicle, and vice versa.

## Powerups

### Magnet Madness
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power1.png" width="400">

- When this powerup is picked up, the player automatically attracts all coins near them temporarily.

### AGV Rampage
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power2.png" width="400">

- This powerup replaces the player’s vehicle with an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV). This both automates and speeds up gameplay for the player.

### Freight Frenzy
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power3.png" width="400">

- This powerup allows the player to automatically enter the “Freight Frenzy” bonus round regardless of his combo bar level to gain bonus points and coins.

## Vehicle Upgrades

### Agility
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power4.png" width="400">

- This upgrade decreases the delay in switching lanes, making gameplay easier.

### Container Points
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power5.png" width="400">

- This upgrade gives the user more points per container collected and dropped off.

### Combo Meter
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power6.png" width="400">

- This upgrade reduces the rate at which the combo meter decreases, making it easier for the player to fill up the combo meter and enter the “Freight Frenzy” bonus stage.

### Extra Lives
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power7.png" width="400">

- This upgrade increases the number of lives the player starts each game with.

### Powerup Frequency
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/erntye/Freight-Frenzy/blob/master/Pallalel/WikiImages/Power8.png" width="400">

- This upgrade increases the frequency of powerups appearing in the game.
